#Instructions
The folder "dataCreation" contains videos, from which the data for the model can be gathered. By calling the function md.extractFramesFromVideo("pathToVideo") of media.py file, images  will be extracted from the video and saved into the "dataCreation/createdImage" folder. Since I implemented it, to track your hands during this process(for easier and better extraction results), make sure that they are visible in the video you use. md.createImageSeries() will iterate over all images in "dataCreation/createdImages" and combine the images to imageSeries for you. These series are stored in "dataCreation/createdImageSeries" You can play around with the parameters to get the best results. After creating your series you can put the ones you think are the most suitable into the ImageSeriesToUse folder. Think of it as our playground/training dataset. The order of image series is the default story line, in which we can find out what objects are stored in the box. Hence make sure, that they are ordered correctly by renaming them. By default the model will think that the box is empty. You can also manualy define a starting point by calling: cb.updateCardboardBoxContentByName(name = "something", quantity = someNumber). <br/>Of course you can always just screenshot your videos or create your own series by hand :)
