    "You are given four images, separated with white lines. \
    What is the person holding in the images? The person can only hold following objects: {','.join(possible_objects)}\

    "A series of images is provided to you. You are asked to provide information about the action that is happening in this series of images. The endgoal is, to tell if there is something inside the cardboard box. To give enough information you are asked to formulate your answer as a JSON object. The JSON structure is as followed: { objects: [ name: "give the object a name" ,  quantity: "quantity", isAdded : "Boolean which is True if the object is added to the cardboard box or False if it is taken away"]}"
